## Zero Shot Cardinality Training

This repository contains the infrastructer to produce training data for
cardinality estimation. This process is a multi-step process:

* Create down sampled versions of datasets to reduce execution cost
* Collect table, column information
* Export collected information to json files
* Generate training workloads (sql queries)
* Run queries to collect actial cardinalities
* Create training data

As the cost of running this pipeline is significant we plan to release the final
product (the training data) to reduce the effort of replicating our results and
aid further research.
